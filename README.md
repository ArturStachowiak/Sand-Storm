## Description
This project simulates a realistic sand storm environment with dynamic particle systems, wind effects, and interactive controls. The simulation features a 3D terrain with customizable weather conditions and visual parameters.

## Features
- Realistic sand particle physics
- Dynamic wind system with adjustable direction and strength
- Interactive 3D camera controls
- Customizable sky colors and lighting
- Terrain generation and rendering
- Real-time parameter adjustment through GUI sliders

## Controls
- W/A/S/D - Move camera
- Q/E - Turn camera left/right
- Shift/Space - Move camera down/up
- Tab - Show/hide cursor
- Esc - Exit application

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- PyOpenGL
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install pygame PyOpenGL numpy`
3. Run the simulation: `python main.py`

## Usage
Use the control panel sliders to adjust:
- Wind direction and strength
- Particle count, mass, and lifetime
- Sky color settings

The simulation provides an immersive 3D environment for studying particle dynamics and weather effects.
